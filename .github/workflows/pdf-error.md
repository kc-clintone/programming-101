### PDF Export Failure

The GitHub Actions workflow tried to export the MkDocs site to PDF but failed during the process.

Please investigate the cause:
- Verify if the content builds correctly locally with `ENABLE_PDF=1 mkdocs build`.
- Check for broken links, unsupported Markdown, or LaTeX rendering issues.

_This issue was created automatically by the CI workflow._
